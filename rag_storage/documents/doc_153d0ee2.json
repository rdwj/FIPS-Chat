You can report actuals against approved Work Orders. Once the status is changed to Approved, the user can no longer delete tasks, labor or materials using the Delete Row (trash can) icon. The user can change the status of individual tasks to Canceled which is similar to deleting a task. The Work Order status can be changed back to Waiting Approval from Approved if other information needs to be modified.
