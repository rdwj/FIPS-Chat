We will cover below the three most common status codes. - 1. When should you update Work Order Status to In Progress ? INPRG In Progress or Initiated ( ) indicates work has started and is In progress or Initiated . In Progress is similar to Approved in that, you cannot delete tasks, labor or materials. You cannot cancel tasks either. However, you can change the status of the Work Order back to Waiting on Approval from In Progress if additional changes need to be made.",

When should you Defer a Work Order (accomplished by updating the PM Results field to DEFER )? DEFER Deferred ( ) indicates that the PM Work Order cannot be completed. This status requires selection of one of the following options in the Deferred Reason field: - \u00b7 CNL -Could Not Locate - \u00b7 IU -In Use - \u00b7 LO -Loaned Out - \u00b7 OOS -Out of Service - \u00b7 OTHER - Other NOTE: If the reason the Work Order was deferred is NOT listed in the options available (listed above), select OTHER in the Deferred Reason field and then type the appropriate reason in the Other Deferral Reason field, which is required before the Work Order can be saved.",

CAN (Canceled) indicates the work will not be performed and is canceled. If the Work Order has already been initiated and has actuals reported against it, you cannot change the status to CAN. If the Work Order has already been initiated but does not have any actuals reported against it, you can change the status to WAPPR (Waiting on Approval) then change to CAN. NOTE: No changes can be made to the Work Order once it has been canceled.

When you notice during a Preventive Maintenance (PM) that you have something that requires Corrective Maintenace (CM), you will create your CM as a follow-up to your PM. - 2. When you have performed a repair to bring a piece of equipment back into service, however it turned out that it still needs further repairs to be in optimal condition.
