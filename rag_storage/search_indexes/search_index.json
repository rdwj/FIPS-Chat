You have the option of automatically receiving key status notifications for any Service Request that you create. Common uses for Service Requests are: - \u00b7 Requesting environmental services (EMS) or (EPS) support to clean a patient room - \u00b7 Issuing a request to logistics (PPM) to turn in an Asset - \u00b7 Requesting repairs on plumbing or electrical systems from Facilities Management (FM) - \u00b7 Reporting malfunctioning biomedical Assets (HTM) NOTE: Individuals creating Service Requests in Maximo are the same individuals who created Work Requests in AEMS/MERS. As you learned in the Service Request Overview module, you can create a new Service Request in Maximo by: - \u00b7 Selecting the New Service Request link in the Quick Insert portlet on your Start Center .

If a PM Work Order must be deferred, a PM Result of DEFER is recorded, and a value is added to describe the reason for deferral. Examples of reasons for deferral include: - \u00b7 Asset could not be located - \u00b7 Asset is out of service - \u00b7 Asset is loaned out A deferred Work Order may be continued to completion if a missing Asset is found within the time frame in which the Work Order must be performed.",

If a PM Work Order must be deferred, a PM Result of DEFER is recorded, and a value is added to describe the reason for deferral. Examples of reasons for deferral include: - \u00b7 Asset could not be located - \u00b7 Asset is out of service - \u00b7 Asset is loaned out A deferred Work Order may be continued to completion if a missing Asset is found within the time frame in which the Work Order must be performed.",
