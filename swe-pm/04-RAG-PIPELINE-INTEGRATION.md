# Chat Guide 04: RAG Pipeline Integration

## Objective
Integrate the search engine with the existing AI chat interface to create a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that enhances responses with relevant document context.

## Prerequisites
- Chat Guide 01 completed (document processing foundation)
- Chat Guide 02 completed (file-based storage system)
- Chat Guide 03 completed (search & retrieval engine)
- TF-IDF search engine working with file storage
- Feature branch: `feature/rag-implementation`

## Goals for This Chat Session
1. Create end-to-end RAG pipeline connecting search to generation
2. Integrate RAG with existing AI client architecture
3. Implement context management and prompt augmentation
4. Add source attribution and citation tracking
5. Create RAG-specific chat modes and controls

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. RAG Pipeline Core
**What to Ask For:**

## Key Implementation Details

### RAGPipeline Class Interface
```python
class RAGPipeline:
    def __init__(
        self,
        storage: FileStorage,
        search_engine: TFIDFSearchEngine,
        ai_client: UnifiedAPIClient,
        max_context_tokens: int = 3000
    ):
        self.storage = storage
        self.search_engine = search_engine
        self.ai_client = ai_client
        self.max_context_tokens = max_context_tokens
        
    def process_rag_query(
        self,
        query: str,
        max_sources: int = 5,
        relevance_threshold: float = 0.1
    ) -> RAGResponse:
        """Process query through complete RAG pipeline"""
        
    def build_context(self, search_results: List[SearchResult]) -> str:
        """Build context string from search results"""
        
    def generate_response_with_context(
        self,
        query: str,
        context: str,
        sources: List[SourceCitation]
    ) -> str:
        """Generate AI response with context and citations"""
```

### RAG Response Structure
```python
@dataclass
class RAGResponse:
    response: str
    sources: List[SourceCitation]
    context_used: str
    relevance_scores: List[float]
    processing_time: float
    rag_mode: str  # "full", "partial", "fallback"
    
@dataclass
class SourceCitation:
    document: str
    page_number: int
    section_title: str
    excerpt: str
    relevance_score: float
    chunk_id: str
```

### Context Management Strategy
```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens: int = 3000):
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        
    def select_best_context(
        self,
        search_results: List[SearchResult],
        query: str
    ) -> Tuple[str, List[SourceCitation]]:
        """Select best context within token limits"""
        
    def estimate_tokens(self, text: str) -> int:
        """Estimate token count for context management"""
        
    def merge_overlapping_chunks(
        self,
        chunks: List[SearchResult]
    ) -> List[SearchResult]:
        """Merge chunks from same document/page"""
```

### RAG Prompt Templates
```python
RAG_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. 
Use the context to inform your response, but also draw on your general knowledge when appropriate.
Always cite your sources when using information from the context.

Context:
{context}

Sources:
{sources}

Question: {query}

Please provide a comprehensive answer and cite relevant sources using [Source: document.pdf, page X] format."""

FALLBACK_PROMPT = """The user asked: {query}

No relevant context was found in the available documents. 
Please provide a helpful response based on your general knowledge and clearly indicate that this response is not based on the provided documents."""
```

### AI Client Extension
```python
# Extension to ai_client.py
class UnifiedAPIClient:
    # ... existing methods ...
    
    def chat_with_rag(
        self,
        query: str,
        rag_pipeline: RAGPipeline,
        **kwargs
    ) -> RAGResponse:
        """Chat with RAG enhancement"""
        return rag_pipeline.process_rag_query(query, **kwargs)
        
    def _format_rag_messages(
        self,
        query: str,
        context: str,
        sources: List[SourceCitation]
    ) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
        """Format messages for RAG-enhanced chat"""
```

### Quality Control Implementation
```python
class RAGQualityController:
    def __init__(self, min_relevance: float = 0.1):
        self.min_relevance = min_relevance
        
    def assess_context_quality(
        self,
        context: str,
        query: str
    ) -> float:
        """Assess quality of retrieved context"""
        
    def detect_hallucination(
        self,
        response: str,
        context: str
    ) -> bool:
        """Detect if response contradicts context"""
        
    def should_use_rag(
        self,
        search_results: List[SearchResult]
    ) -> bool:
        """Determine if RAG should be used based on result quality"""
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Chat Interface
- Add RAG mode toggle in chat interface
- Display source citations with responses
- Show context snippets in expandable sections
- Indicate when RAG vs. standard mode used

### With Session Management
- Track RAG usage in session state
- Store RAG responses with metadata
- Manage RAG configuration per session

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful fallback to non-RAG when search fails
- Handle AI client errors during RAG processing
- Manage context length violations
- Report processing errors to user

## Success Criteria for This Chat
- ✅ Complete RAG pipeline processes queries end-to-end
- ✅ Context management respects token limits and quality
- ✅ Source attribution works correctly for all responses
- ✅ Integration with existing AI client is seamless
- ✅ Quality controls prevent poor RAG responses
- ✅ Performance meets response time requirements (< 5 seconds)

## RAG Modes to Support
1. **Full RAG**: High-relevance context found, use RAG enhancement
2. **Partial RAG**: Some relevant context, blend with general knowledge
3. **Fallback**: No relevant context, use standard chat mode
4. **Hybrid**: User can see both RAG and non-RAG responses

## Next Chat Guide
After completing the RAG pipeline, proceed to **Chat Guide 05: User Interface Components** to create the document upload and RAG chat interfaces.

## Notes for Implementation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing chat functionality
- Test with all supported AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Optimize for memory-constrained environment
- Ensure source citations are accurate and helpful
- Monitor response quality and user feedback
- Handle edge cases gracefully (empty context, long queries, etc.)
